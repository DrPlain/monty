:wq
Write a c program to be compiled with the name monty
The program takes only one argument, a file name
The file will contain opcodes which are function names
Create a loop to read the file line by line
After reading a line, parse it to search for a function nam    e(opcode)
Tokenize the function name
If token is a valid function name(opcode),
call the function associated with it
Empty lines or lines starting with '#' should be neglected
Continue the loop until EOF is reached
Free all dynamically allocated  memories
