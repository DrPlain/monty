# Monty Bytecode Interpreter
## Documentation
### Description
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. This project was one of my projects during my one year software engineering programme at ALX Africa.

		gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
	
	usage: ./monty <filename>
		1. filename should contain the Operators
		2. One operator per line
